        "In this assignment, you will:\n",
        "- Apply unsupervised learning to explore patterns in hotel booking behavior\n",
        "- Use K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for customer segmentation\n",
        "- Evaluate model quality with metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index\n",

        "\n",
        "Businesses like hotels and travel platforms (e.g., Airbnb or Expedia) rely on customer segmentation to tailor promotions, pricing strategies, and service levels. Unlike supervised models, clustering helps uncover patterns when no labels exist‚Äîan ideal tool when entering new markets or analyzing unstructured customer behavior.\n",

Most challenging about unsupervised learning: there is no single ground truth; choosing the right features, selecting cluster counts (k) and interpreting clusters require domain knowledge and iteration. Evaluation metrics (silhouette, Davies-Bouldin) are useful but imperfect ‚Äî they don't replace business sense.</br>\n",

When to use clustering instead of supervised models: use clustering when you lack labeled outcomes (e.g., you don't have \"customer-type\" labels) and want to discover natural groupings for personalization, product development, or exploration. Use supervised learning when you have a labeled target to predict (churn, cancellation)</br>\n",

Explaining value to a non-technical manager: clustering segments guests into a few actionable groups ‚Äî for each group we can design targeted promotions, pricing, and operations (leading to higher revenue and better guest satisfaction). It's a way to convert a huge, messy dataset into a small set of customer archetypes.</br>\n",
