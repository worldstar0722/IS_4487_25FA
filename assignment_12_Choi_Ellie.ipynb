        "- Understand how to use classification models (Naïve Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks) to predict hotel cancellations.\n",
        "- Compare models in terms of accuracy, complexity, and business relevance.\n",

        "1. Build and evaluate three models: Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Neural Network.\n",

It provides strong predictive accuracy and interpretability, helping hotel management anticipate booking cancellations and make better staffing, inventory, and revenue decisions. While the Neural Network offers slightly higher accuracy, its complexity makes it less transparent. Adding data such as customer loyalty, seasonal pricing, and cancellation reasons could further improve performance.\n",
